#A binary tree is a structure where each node has at most two children

#       root node
#        /    \
#       /      \
# left child   right child

# The depth of a node is how many nodes it is away from the root
# The dead ends of the tree are called leaves, and the height of a node is how many nodes another node is from its furthest leaf

# In a complete binary tree, every level except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
#Â A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

#now that we've built our tree lets traverse it

#----- Traversal -----#

#   Traversal is the process of visitin each node in a tree data structure,exactly once. Unlike linear linked lists which can be accessed in a logical fashion, bin trees can be
# accessed in many different ways.

#   Can be traversed depth-first or bredth-first
#   Some depth-first traversal methods are in-order, pre-order and post-order.

#----- Pre-order Traversal -----#

# 1. Check if current node is empty or null
# 2. Display data or current node
# 3. Traverse left subtree by calling pre-order method recursively
# 4. Traverse right subtree by calling pre-order method 

# visit, left, right

#----- In-order Traversal -----#

# 1. Check if current node is empty or null
# 2. Traverse left subtree by calling pre-order method recursively
# 3. Display data or current node
# 4. Traverse right subtree by calling pre-order method 

#  left, visit, right


#----- post-order Traversal -----#

# 1. Check if current node is empty or null
# 2. Traverse left subtree by calling pre-order method recursively
# 3. Traverse right subtree by calling pre-order method
# 4. Display data or current node

#left, right, visit

print(tree.print_tree("preorder"))
print(tree.print_tree("inorder"))
print(tree.print_tree("postorder"))
print(tree.print_tree("levelorder"))



#----- Level-Order traversal -----#

# This is a type of bredth-first traversal. instead of using a stack we use a queuing system instead. We have to define a class called Queue (opposite of stack)
#   as first index is last in the queue and last index is first in the queue (cyle via A[-1])
#   We basically look at each level and look at what values are one each level

#            ___1___             Level 1
#          /        \
#         /          \
#        /            \
#       2              3         Level 2
#     /   \       
#    /     \        
#   4       5                    Level 3

# we start at Level 1: We add 1 to the queue
#                      Then we remove from q and add it to the traversal string

# we move on to Level 2: We add 2 and 3 (the children of the node we de-"q"ed) the to the q
#                      : we remove 2 from the q and then add 4 and 5 to the q (as they are the children of 2 which we just de-"q"ed)

#  Level 3: We remove 3 and because it has no children we can then simply remove 4 and 5 too, This will make Traversal = 12345
